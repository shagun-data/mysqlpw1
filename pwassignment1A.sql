1. This query creates an 'employees' table with various constraints.

/*
Q2. Explain the purpose of constraints and how they help maintain data integrity 
in a database. Provide examples of common types of constraints.
*/

-- Constraints are rules applied to table columns to maintain data integrity.
-- They prevent invalid, duplicate, or inconsistent data entries.

-- Common types of constraints:

-- 1. PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies each record.
--    Example: emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY

-- 2. NOT NULL: Prevents NULL values in a column.
--    Example: emp_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL

-- 3. UNIQUE: Ensures all values in a column are different.
--    Example: email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE

-- 4. CHECK: Validates data using a condition.
--    Example: age INT CHECK (age >= 18)

-- 5. DEFAULT: Assigns a default value when none is provided.
--    Example: salary DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 30000.00

-- 6. FOREIGN KEY: Links records between tables and maintains referential integrity.
--    Example: dept_id INT REFERENCES departments(dept_id)

/*
Q3. Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? 
Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify your answer.
*/

-- The NOT NULL constraint ensures that a column cannot have NULL values.
-- It is used to enforce that all rows must have a value in that column.
-- A PRIMARY KEY cannot contain NULL values because:
-- 1. It must uniquely identify each row.
-- 2. NULL represents an unknown value, which breaks uniqueness.
-- Therefore, NULLs are not allowed in primary key columns.

/*
Q4. Explain the steps and SQL commands used to add or remove constraints on an existing table.
Provide an example for both adding and removing a constraint.
*/

-- To ADD a constraint:
-- Use ALTER TABLE with ADD CONSTRAINT.

ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_age CHECK (age >= 18);

-- To REMOVE a constraint:
-- Use ALTER TABLE with DROP CONSTRAINT (if named), or DROP CHECK (in MySQL).

ALTER TABLE employees
DROP CHECK chk_age;

/*
Q5. Explain the consequences of attempting to insert, update, or delete data in a way that violates constraints.
Provide an example of an error message that might occur when violating a constraint.
*/

-- Violating constraints causes errors and prevents invalid data from being inserted or updated.
-- This maintains data accuracy and integrity.

-- Example: Trying to insert NULL into a NOT NULL column

#INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, emp_name) VALUES (101, NULL);

-- Possible Error:
-- ERROR 1048 (23000): Column 'emp_name' cannot be null

/*
Q6. You created a products table without constraints. Now you realize that:
- product_id should be a PRIMARY KEY
- price should have a DEFAULT value of 50.00
*/
ALTER TABLE products
ADD PRIMARY KEY (product_id);

ALTER TABLE products

#SQL COMMANDS
/*
Q1. Identify the primary keys and foreign keys in the Maven Movies database.
Also, discuss the difference between them.
*/

-- ðŸ”‘ PRIMARY KEYS in Maven Movies DB (some examples):
-- These uniquely identify each row in a table.

-- Example:
-- film(film_id) â†’ PRIMARY KEY
-- actor(actor_id) â†’ PRIMARY KEY
-- customer(customer_id) â†’ PRIMARY KEY
-- rental(rental_id) â†’ PRIMARY KEY

-- ðŸ”— FOREIGN KEYS in Maven Movies DB:
-- These create relationships between tables.

-- Example:
-- film_actor(film_id) â†’ FOREIGN KEY referencing film(film_id)
-- film_actor(actor_id) â†’ FOREIGN KEY referencing actor(actor_id)
-- payment(customer_id) â†’ FOREIGN KEY referencing customer(customer_id)
-- rental(inventory_id) â†’ FOREIGN KEY referencing inventory(inventory_id)

-- âœ… Difference:
-- PRIMARY KEY:
-- - Uniquely identifies each record.
-- - Cannot be NULL.
-- - One per table.

-- FOREIGN KEY:
-- - Links to the PRIMARY KEY of another table.
-- - Can have duplicates and NULLs (in some cases).
-- - Ensures referential integrity between tables.
